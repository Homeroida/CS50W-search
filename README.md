# Google Search HTML Page

## Video Demo: https://youtu.be/aZ_X5ctXcCw

This repository contains three HTML files that mimic the Google Search, Advance Search, and Image Search pages. The HTML files are:

- index.html: This file contains the basic Google Search page, with a search box and two buttons ("Google Search" and "I'm Feeling Lucky"). The search box is implemented using a form tag that sends a GET request to https://google.com/search with the q query parameter containing the user's search query.
- advance_search.html: This file contains the advanced search page, with four search boxes for more specific search queries ("All these words", "Exact phrase", "Any of these words", and "None of these words"). The search boxes are also implemented using a form tag that sends a GET request to https://google.com/search with various query parameters (as_q, as_epq, as_oq, and as_eq) based on the user's input.
- image_search.html: This file contains the image search page, with a search box and a button ("Google Images"). The search box is implemented using a form tag that sends a GET request to https://images.google.com/search with the q query parameter containing the user's search query and the tbm query parameter set to "isch", indicating that the search is for images.
